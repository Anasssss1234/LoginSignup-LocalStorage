# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

- # LoginSignup using LocalStorage
 i made a LocalSignup (SAP) using React.Js and MIUI. i have added all the functionality that a LoginSignup wants basically i used Modals
 when you click on SignUp button a PopUp has open. when you fill all the details then all the data has stores in react LocalStorage.
 along with this i have made Logout , ChangePassword, DleteAccount functionality as well .
